//problems of threads: visibility, autonomy, happens before

//the problem here: the sCount is not visible between threads. consumer doesnt see the changes there.
//this is because sCount is cached locally and not reading it from memory
//this is a problem of multiple threads share the same state
//the fix here is to add the 'volatile' word to the sCount
